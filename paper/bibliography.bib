abstract = {Recently, deep neural networks have attracted great attention in photoacoustic imaging (PAI). In PAI, reconstructing the initial pressure distribution from acquired photoacoustic (PA) signals is a typically inverse problem. In this paper, an end-to-end Unet with residual blocks (Res-Unet) is designed and trained to solve the inverse problem in PAI. The performance of the proposed algorithm is explored and analyzed by comparing a recent model-resolution-based regularization algorithm (MRR) with numerical and physical phantom experiments. The improvement obtained in the reconstructed images was more than 95\&\#x0025; in pearson correlation and 39\&\#x0025; in peak signal-to-noise ratio in comparison to the MRR. The Res-Unet also achieved superior performance over the state-of-the-art Unet\&\#x002B;\&\#x002B; architecture by more than 18\&\#x0025; in PSNR in simulation experiments.},
