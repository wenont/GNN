  abstract   = {Machine learning on graphs, especially using graph neural networks ({GNNs}), has seen a surge in interest due to the wide availability of graph data across a broad spectrum of disciplines, from life to social and engineering sciences. Despite their practical success, our theoretical understanding of the properties of {GNNs} remains highly incomplete. Recent theoretical advancements primarily focus on elucidating the coarse-grained expressive power of {GNNs}, predominantly employing combinatorial techniques. However, these studies do not perfectly align with practice, particularly in understanding the generalization behavior of {GNNs} when trained with stochastic first-order optimization techniques. In this position paper, we argue that the graph machine learning community needs to shift its attention to developing a balanced theory of graph machine learning, focusing on a more thorough understanding of the interplay of expressive power, generalization, and optimization.},
